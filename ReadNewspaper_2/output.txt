their money, the court said.

"It is harsh if you close all
options for genuine persons

within _ the _ stipulated
period," a Bench of Chief
Justice of India J.S. Khehar
and D.Y. Chandrachud told

minally ill and could not de-
posit my money, I should be
given an opportunity now to
approach you and establish
my facts and prove that it is
my money... You can't just
deprive me of my money be-
cause I am terminally ill,"
